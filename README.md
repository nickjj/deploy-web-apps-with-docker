You can buy [Deploy web apps with
Docker](https://leanpub.com/deploy-web-apps-with-docker) on LeanPub.

Just as a fair warning I maintained this book for years but it's no longer
being updated. This repo is up to ensure folks who have the book can access the
material. An up to date list of courses I've created around building and
deploying web apps can be found here <https://nickjanetakis.com/courses/>.
